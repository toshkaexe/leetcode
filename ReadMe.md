## Semaphore Task

### Description

The Semaphore Task in Kontext is designed to demonstrate the usage of semaphores, particularly in scenarios involving database operations. Semaphores help control access to shared resources and prevent race conditions.

### Implementation

The Semaphore Task implementation can be found in the `semaphore_task` directory. Follow the provided documentation and code comments to understand the solution.

## Largest Element

### Description

The Largest Element task challenges you to find the largest element in a given array. This simple yet fundamental problem is useful for practicing array manipulation and basic algorithmic thinking.

### Implementation

Check the `largest_element` directory for the implementation of the Largest Element task. The solution is designed to be efficient and scalable.

## Shortest Palindrome

### Description

The Shortest Palindrome task requires finding the shortest palindrome that can be obtained by adding characters to the beginning of a given string. This task is excellent for practicing string manipulation and pattern recognition.

### Implementation

Explore the `shortest_palindrome` directory for the implementation details. Follow the provided documentation to understand the approach taken to solve this task.

## Ugly Number

### Description

The Ugly Number task challenges you to determine whether a given number is an "ugly" number. An ugly number is a positive integer whose prime factors are limited to 2, 3, and 5. This task is useful for practicing number theory and basic algorithmic concepts.

### Implementation

Refer to the `ugly_number` directory for the implementation of the Ugly Number task. The solution demonstrates an efficient way to check if a number is "ugly."
